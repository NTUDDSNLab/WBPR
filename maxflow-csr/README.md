# maxflow-cuda
Implementation of the maximum network flow problem in CUDA. Uses the parallel push-relabel algorithm, as illustrated in this <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123859631000058"> paper</a> .

The program depicts the values of height, excess flow and the residual flow for each node at each iteration, along with the maximum flow obtained. It also runs a serial version of the push relabel algorithm and verifies the output.

## Execution :

```
To build the project, run :
make

```
```
To run the algorithm :
./maxflow <path of the edgelist file> <number of vertices> <number of edges> <source vertex> <sink vertex>

In file "edgelist.txt", edge input to be given in the form :
<end of edge 0> <end of edge 0> <capacity of edge 0>
<end of edge 1> <end of edge 1> <capacity of edge 1>
<end of edge 2> <end of edge 2> <capacity of edge 2>
...

```
```
To clean, run :
make clean
```

## Notices
1. The vertex ID in the `edgelist.txt` should start from 0 not 1.
